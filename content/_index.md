# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Abhimanyu — but you might stumble across `@asikarwar` in some corners of the internet. I work at [KODO](https://kodo.com/) where I focus mainly on Frontend engineering along with handling infrastructure and observability.
<!-- 
I like to [tinker](https://github.com/abhimanyu-sikarwar) with stuff around monitoring, networking and distributed systems.

When I'm not in the tech zone, I'm probably playing badminton, on a road trip, or experimenting in the kitchen. I've got a soft spot for indie music too, and I've curated some of my favorites on [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5dvbrw93FgUhsZdbnpF3JM). -->
